## Because we all want to be efficient...
Cloe's primary purpose is to make your lives easier and more efficient. She will
assist you with various personal responsibilities, such as managing time,
money, or health. All you have to do is tell her what you need.

## Because some tasks are just tedious...
Besides personal managing, Cloe is also built to do simple, yet tedious tasks,
such as opening websites and searching things on Google. 

## Because not everyone has an iPhone...
Cloe is a personal assistant software, just like Siri or Alexa, but on a web browser, which means she can be accessed from any device that has a browser, even if the device isn't yours.

## Future Plan for Development of Cloe.
1. Face detection / pass-phrase for login.
2. Smarter Natural Language Processing.
3. Larger-scale cloud server.
4. Personalized features that can be installed.
